# Frontend Test 1

## Introduction
Create a React.js application that utilizes the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs) as the backend. The app provides various features, including authentication pages, post listing, and post details.

## Setup and Installation
Create a new React project with Vite:
```
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-react-app
```

## Requirements
- Written in TypeScript to provide type safety and better developer experience.
- The application includes a login page and a logout flow.
- The app displays a list of posts and provides a detailed view of a specific post.
- Use Axios to handle API calls to the DummyJSON backend.
- Use a modern design system or a headless UI library for styling.
- Handle State Management with MobX, Redux, React Context or etc.

## Bonus Works
- Deployment with Netlify: providing a live demo.
- Dockerization: Create a Docker image for the application, making it easy to deploy and run in a containerized environment.
